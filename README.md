# Event Logging XML Schema

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gchq/event-loggin-schema.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/gchq/event-logging-schema)

Event Logging is an XML Schema for describing the auditable events generated by computer systems, hardware devices and access control systems. It is intended to act as a common standard that bespoke logging formats (such as Apache web server or linux auditd logs) can be translated into, using a tool such as [Stroom](https://github.com/gchq/stroom).

The aim of the schema is to normalise logging data into a common form meaning that analysts do not need to understand multiple log formats all with their own unique features. Also normalised log events from a bespoke system can be understood years after the event was created and when the development team responsible for the bespokse system have all disappeared.

This schema has been in use since 2009 and has evolved over that time to cater for the wide variety of auditable events seen on production systems. It is used as the common language for event logging for hundreds of applications, operating systems and hardware devices, ranging from commercial off-the-shelf products to bespoke in-house applications. 

For bespoke in-house systems the schema serves as common approach to creating auditable events, and reduces the need for the developers to re-invent a new log event structure and taxonomy.
