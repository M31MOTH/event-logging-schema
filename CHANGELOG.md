# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) 
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

i.e. \<Major version\>.\<Minor version\>.\<Patch version\>

The namespace of the schema includes the major version, e.g. _event-logging:3_. This is to reflect the fact that a change to the major version number is a breaking change and thus a different namespace should be used.

Minor and patch versions will be backwards compatible with other versions at the same major version number. The minor and patch version numbers are included in the _version_ and _id_ attributes of the _xs:schema_ element.

Minor version changes may included new optional elements or attributes. They may also include changes to such things as enumerations or paterns that are addative in nature.

Patch version changes will typically include cosmetic changes (e.g. _xs:documentation_ changes.
