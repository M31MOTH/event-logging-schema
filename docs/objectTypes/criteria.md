# Criteria
This is used to describe the criteria applied in any kind of search or filter operation along with the returned results, if known.  The `<Query>` element is used to record the actual query terms used, either in its raw form (e.g. SQL or XPath), as a nested hierarchy of operators and expressions or as a set of simple `<Include>` or `<exclude>` elements.
